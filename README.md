Example code for 1. multinomial logistic regression and 2. skigram training algorithm, implemented with `Python` and `numpy` from scratch . These were used as educational examples in Brandeis university COSI114B course, *Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing II* in 2021 spring semester. Note that both code depend on `logres.py` module which is not uploaded here, because it was originally implemented as a solution code for a programming assignment of the course.
