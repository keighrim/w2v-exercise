ok just need clean space sleep just finished 5-night stay comfort suites downtown seattle moved hotel road night heading home, boy surprised difference hotel facility, stayed quality inn/suites past far favorite, quality inns/suites not comfort inns/suites operated hotel family chain expect equivalent similar quality standard especially hotels 300 feet away, despite quality inn/suites downtown seattle offers clean basic rooms maybe 5-10 pricing somewhat run-down facility bear-cave feel small dark old, guess just want simple basic place stay day budget conscious q hotel seattle okay choice, mediocre overall upgrades definitely needed hotel,
