heart ginza great location taking metro bit tiring female travelers walk yurakucho nearest railway station heavy suitcase, catching taxi solution avoid rush hours, rooms small ca n't complain considering location price, like japanese hotels amenities fairly good, bathroom quite spacious bed wide probably reasons came times despite unfriendly staff, n't recommend french restaurant overpriced quality, options dine anyways, enjoy stay,
