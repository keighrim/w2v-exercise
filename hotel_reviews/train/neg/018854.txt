unfortunate experience reading reviews excited stay hotel, unfortunately did not experience others.from moment entered room noticed loud thud coming roof noise occurred minute did not away duration stay, repeatedly asked come look problem did 5 6 times nights fixed, asked just hours room day kept saying send engineer fix noise instead, ultimately refused send engineer look room 6th time did finally allow change rooms, worst did not apologize issue bothering just trying sleep not light sleeper means, quite disappointed,
