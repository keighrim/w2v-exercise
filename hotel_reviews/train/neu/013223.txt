thought hotelwas ok 3 week trip california nevada picked hotels based entirely trip adviosr reviews disappointed with.perhaps expecting no reason not like hotel just small boutique type hotels attention breakfast included etc.when checked fairly hard sell upgrade larger/better room felt uncomforatble declining.all saw hotel literally walking room no contact hotel all.although area tacky did like situated stay area again.our deluxe bay view room overlooked hotel not thought misleading lean window bit bay view room acurately overlooked park side.so nothing wrong complain just average experience,
