hmmmm placed night tour operator flight home delayed 24 hours tropical storm resort staying previous 14 nights, reception chaos lots travellers boat receptionists coped got checked fairly quickly, rooms basic resort purporting 5*, little unfair clean extremely tired dated looking especially having brand new modern resort previous 2 weeks, grounds great loads palm trees birds like flamingos herons running place, pool small number guests, beach area good plenty beds shade inclusive watersports, main public areas like reception bar restaurants not air-conditioned tropics problem, overall fine emergency one-night stop far better modern resorts close,
