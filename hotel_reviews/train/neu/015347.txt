not expected stayed family oct going 6 day cruise frankly disappointed, booked tower wing room offered garden wing room extra fee, asked look, garden wing showed shabby run, certainly not read website, tower wing room nice small, expected, breakfast line restaurant excellent pool area nice, location far liking taxi cheap readily available, stayed raffles plaza way cruise better, location excellent large room overlooking city large balcony, know staying time certainly not shangri-la,
