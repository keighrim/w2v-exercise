nice not quite great resort wife stayed resort week july, large clean beautiful resort, couple things better overall nice experience, weather absolutely great morning afternoon basked sun, couple heavy showers evenings golf umbrellas provided room rain does n't confine room, ocean blue great place relaxing vacation.we booked cheapest type room spacious clean, slight problems sink 2 bathroom n't big deal, hair dryer did n't work replaced making 2 service calls, forced 1 cold shower water temperature fine, biggest complaint room dampness ac running musty smell drawers tropical environment accepted effect, beer not restocked minibar unless requested good supply bottled water soft drinks, stayed villa 3 garden view, thought perfect location directly restaurant/lobby area pool/beach area, comfortable walk end resort quiet away busiest areas, took complimentary shuttle, whichever villa stay just make sure garden pool view.the beach nice water calm swimming bit seaweed, large roped area swimming, small motor boats banana boats kayaks ride close outer edge swim area does not cause problem swimmers, water activity building beach advantage free non-motorized activities pay fee motorized activities, 1 2 seat kayaks nice enjoy water little exercise, plenty lounge chairs shade available sand, fairly large market area beach, vendors pushy n't, looked stores wanted bought place deals tend better buying multiple items, start negotiations 50 asking price n't higher, walk away n't like price normally vendor unless totally unreasonable, shopping better late afternoon business slow vendors willing make good minute deals closing, ended getting 3 items originally offered 45 total 23, man called cheap accepted n't say personally know market suckers 2 pools huge nice, water warm, pool closer beach louder make sure pick right want, plenty lounge chairs available interested shade umbrella early claim spot, wanted shade went 9:00 a.m. usually got umbrellas available, people early claim spots disappear quite long time.the bars ok. premium liquors available usually request, draft beer presedente couple bottled brands hidden sight, biggest problem getting frozen drinks pool bars, took little liquids dispensers freeze did drinks gone quickly, children drink virgin daquiries pina coladas making supply run short quickly, better shot frozen drink near lunch buffet just beach, lobby bar live entertainment hours night crowd comfortably large times, drinks came quicker picking specific bartender tipping served, sports bar probably best bar crowd did n't really build 10:00 11:00 p.m. open night, want served quickly n't mind small crowd earlier evening drunk quickly watching espn.the food average, buffet large good items eat not really stood, service slow crowded buffet asked help servers friendly helpful, not lot changes food day day easily tired eating make sure men long pants forced eat buffet day restaurants dress code men, lunch buffet beach offerings pasta hamburgers hot dogs pizza chicken fish rice beans salads fruits ice cream, n't great got job, 2 buffets lunch choices, full-service restaurants nicer buffets small large resort, seating normally line 6:30. tables n't usually turned quickly probably servers n't working tips actually wotnessed couple heated arguments guests waiting tables hosts, tried dominican restaurant awesome soup mexican restaurant mexico times place ok food salsa taco bar excellent finally finding hidden gem caribbean grill beach, not sure night n't near restaurant row maybe people turned lunch buffet location, problem getting seat food best, great chicken wings great seafood good meat sampler platter, nice eating open air beach, did not try 2 restaurants pay extra seafood restaurant steak restaurant 35usd person, did not try italian restaurant dominicans know italian food, did not try american restaurant did not d.r, eat food easily home, little coffee/pastry shop nice plenty desserts coffee choices newspapers different languages employees understood english, place eat 11:00 sports bar n't expect, try fish fingers looked like grocery store frozen fish sticks tasted better, couple times not real meal arrived day late evening ready dinner place eat approximately 10 pm 11 pm coffee shop, hour later morning no food available careful skipping breakfast, love good food ocean blue food situation probably real area use big improvements, not bad food like better average food vacation, main reason usually avoid all-inclusives.we took 1 tour outback safari, quite experience, bit expensive 79usd pp welcome adventure, problem hot weather dusty roads bumpy ride want consider involves air conditioned bus ride want experience little real dominican life tour, saw beautiful scenery different animals different food plants trees small villages got lot historical information excellent tour guide, stops including toured small house got coffee samples lunch little time relax and/or shop farm sampled freshly roasted coffee fresh cocoa fresh fruits mamajuana local alcoholic drink not drug, end trip took beach boogie boards provided, pay attention children come wave truck passes n't forget camera, beer soft drinks water offered no additional cost truck.i felt bit ripped checkout not sure scheme honest mistake, check desk order travel ticket apple vacations transfer, man desk insisted long distance room not ticket paid, refused asked step aside manager, went checking people, 10 minutes bus loading manager shown, choice fight charge miss bus just pay charge, paid charge got ticket headed, ripoff clerk hopefully good use, advice not wait possible minute check just case problem arises.in conclusion wanted all-inclusive vacation d.r. probably return resort price reasonable clean great relaxation, problems easy past just think work, no resort 100 perfect n't let bad expeiences read site deter going, just n't expecting new york-style 4 star hotel n't close caribbean maybe unless pay arm leg,
