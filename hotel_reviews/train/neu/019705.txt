just average n't overly impressed orchard garden hotel, good location think great green, save energy room lights turn room key card slot cool idea, recyling bins room, did n't like bathroom sliding door, n't door sealed shut like panel slides open space door did n't feel completely private, desk guys not particularly friendly, business center small room 2 computers printer did n't print, lobby 2 small couches not lot space hang, ice machines floor no signs pointing roam halls, mom room couple items taken face cremes room cleaned, place no big deal somewhat disappointing,
