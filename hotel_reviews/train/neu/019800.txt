high end mediocrity great lobby wonderful bar lovely room, room lacked small amenities make hotel stay comfortable like simple coffee maker free internet access, places like homewood suites raddisson offering free access high end chains cheap restaurant nice breakfast not worth cost, n't expect friendly service, harbour hotel door feel special spend, location great exploring waterfront north end, n't expect borrow umbrella raining, none day long, small disappointment.overall high end price not worth mediocre experience,
