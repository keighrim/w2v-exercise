great location stayed sw hotel nights march 2006. hotel situated authentic busy chinatown fine italian restaurants north beach.the hotel appeared deserted entire time think saw guest, looks like recently remodeled good standard, nice chinese style furniture decor, room little small horrible view clean practical, wife enjoyed short walk fisherman wharf surrounding areas, eatery choices quite excellent, parking interesting, way lot underneath hotel real problem getting, bizaare parking lot seen.overall hotel 3/5, pretty pay,
