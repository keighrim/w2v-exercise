not bad bit walk chosen hotel based reviews trip advisor, overall stay okay, got barcelona 10:00 let check early nice, hotel 5-7 minute walk closest subway station nothing particularly special street like pretty long boring walk, does n't air conditioning rooms ca n't imagine styaing like middle summer, did like fact computers internet connections lobby, pretty quiet area, groccery store block away good want pick water snacks cheaply, think paid 160 night n't best deal, money think prefer stay little closer main tourist areas little closer subway station,
