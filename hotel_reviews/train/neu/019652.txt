great location, recently spent 6 nights kuta lagoon resort pool villas, stayed pool access room recommend standard rooms, breakfast excellent service great, indulged massages absolutley relaxing, pool area lacking cleanliness, pool correct chlorine ect garden grew pool constantly leaves, needed clean day, alot people complaining, nights great horrendous couple rose early just walking floor sounded like herd elephants no sleeping thats sure recommend villas seperate rest hotel hope alot quiter, swim pool bar open, overall value money definitely not quiet hotel,
