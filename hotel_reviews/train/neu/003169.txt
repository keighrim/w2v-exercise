melia falls short paradise resort beautiful, grounds maintained groomed, pool area nice beach spectacular reason rate resort ok service lack, service extremely slow, took 1.5 hours meals ordered food, laid vacation service resort pushes buttons, pay alot money come expect better service, language barrier problem, different resorts far worst having people understand, problem getting towels shampoo definitely visit area look different resort stay time,
