fine especially airport hotel stayed stamford airport 8/16, room quiet clean beds comfortable, no airport noise, used gym outdoor pool quite cool child used, ended eating hotel restaurant no options existed, food quite good service slow servers somewhat disinterested check not accurate took time corrected, beware hotel irons tried iron shirt dirty imprint shirt, took shuttle international terminal early morning confirm need reserve space ahead time, overall stay not use pool irons order room service,
